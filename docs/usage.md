Usage
-----

Using `bou` is very easy and intuitive. It works just like GNOME 3, but without
all the noise and distractions. It's based on two strong principles:

- Desktop will always be empty and clean.
- Keyboard over mouse.

When you start using `bou`, this is and always be your desktop:

Click `Super` button (a.k.a. Windows button) and the search dashboard will show up:

Start typing so you can find your applications, files and directories pretty quickly:

Everything else is pretty much as simple as this. Just move around the dashboard
with your keyboard or mouse! Also, take a look at the following shortcuts,
