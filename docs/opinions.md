Strong opinions
---------------

- Desktop should be clean, no panels, no docks, no notifications.
- It's easier to open programs by typing than by clicking.
- GNOME feels clean, smooth and fast these days.
- GNOME Tweaks is an indispensable app.
- Minimize and Maximize windows buttons are expendable.
- Wayland over X.org, if possible.
- `apt` works well as default package manager, no need to install Snap or Flatpak.
- Homebrew is the best option to distribute command line tools and narrow the gap with macOS.
- `git`, `curl`, `vim`, `tmux`, `jq` and others are essential programs for any modern distribution.
- Terminator over other terminal emulators, split windows support is great.
- Every development machine needs Docker support nowadays.
- `zsh` with Oh My Zsh as main shell, with `bash` always available.
- Visual Studio Code is the best text editor in case you don't use `vim`.
- Firefox as default web browser.
- Google Chrome over Chromium.
- You can stream music in a web browser or Spotify, but if you need mp3 support just install Rhythmbox.
- LibreOffice is bloated, but you're one command away to install it.
- Email in a browser over in native app, but you can install Thunderbird or Evolution otherwise.
- No strong opinions about backups, but Restic is good.
- Ubuntu font hasn't aged well. Arimo for desktop, Hack for terminal.
