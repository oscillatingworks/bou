Download
--------

Releases can be found in the [Release page](https://github.com/oscillatingworks/bou/releases).

Each release contains two items:

- Link to download the ISO image
- MD5 checksum of the ISO image

You need the ISO image for installing `bou`, which can be validated against the attached
checksum by running `md5sum <path-to-md5-checksum>`.
